# Simulator for Tenstorrent architecture

This is a software simulator for the Tenstorrent architecture in large part based upon the [Tenstorrent ISA Documentation](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-isa-documentation/tree/main). It currently provides an (incomplete) implementation of the Wormhole, but has been developed so that it can be easily enhanced and support a range of future architectures too.
